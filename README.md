# Notes

I am using this repository for all the notes on the programming classes I am taking. Because there are many code snippets and other things of that nature, it will allow me to keep my notes better formatted. Feel free to read, but they are mostly stream of consciousness so I'm not sure how useful they'll be to another person. 

## Classes

I've taken others, and copious notes, but I'll have to convert them from GoogleDocs ðŸ˜¬
